## Problem Statement
* In this CTF problem statement, we were given a folder with many folders inside it and within each folder, there were around 50 files each.
* This was a scripting Task. It was given that the last two characters from all files taken together constitutes the Flag.
* ```task.sh``` automates this task and ```task.cpp``` concatenates all the last two characters from each file.
